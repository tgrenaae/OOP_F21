## Exercise: 

Lets make a **SolarSystem** class where the planets are internally stored in alphabetical order. 

Follow these steps:

1. **Planet** class needs to implement the **Comparable<Planet>** interface. Use the method **comparator** of the class String
as a helper to implement this interface.

3. Change the field **planets** in the class **SolarSystem** to a type of collection that can handle ordered items (e.g. **TreeSet**).

4. Run the **Demo** class and see how the planets now are properly ordered.
